Declarative: Create simple views for each state in application and react will efficiently update and render just the right components when data changes.

Virtual DOM: A virtual DOM object has similar properties as a real DOM object. It is a one-way data binding hence manipulating the virtual DOM is quick rather than updating the original DOM.

Event Handling: React has a distinct way of handling events. Rather than directly targeting DOM events. React wraps them in their own event wrapper.

JavaScript extensions(JSX): Using JSX while concise HTML/XML-like structures in the same file as you while javascript code then Babel will transform these expressions into actual JavaScript Code.

Performance: React binds data with an application architecture called Flux controls. It helps us update the view for the user and with Flux can control the application workflow.

Component Based: Application UI is wrapped inside a self-contained module known as a component. Components are used to define the visuals and interactions in applications.
